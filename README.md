Sway Away: Tourist Guide Management System

Sway Away is a desktop-based Tourist Guide Management System designed to improve travel experiences by offering features like location-based services, route planning, and personalized itinerary management. Built using Python and PyQt, this application integrates real-time navigation through the Google Maps API, ensuring seamless exploration for travelers.

Features
User Modules

Tourist Registration and Profile Management: Users can create accounts and manage their profiles.
Search and Explore Tourist Spots: Users can search destinations based on categories or specific locations.
Personalized Itineraries: Tourists can create, update, and customize their itineraries dynamically.
Administrative Modules

Manage Tourist Spots: Admins can add, update, or remove details of tourist locations.

User Statistics: Admins can analyze popular destinations and track user activity.

Key Functionalities

Real-Time Navigation: Integrated with Google Maps API to provide live location-based services and route planning.
Search and Recommendations: Uses tree-based algorithms for search auto-completion and accurate recommendations.
Route Optimization: Graph algorithms are implemented to determine the shortest and most efficient travel routes.
Backtracking Navigation: Stack-based implementation allows revisiting previous routes easily.
Dynamic Itinerary Updates: Linked lists manage flexible addition or removal of locations in user itineraries.
Search History Management: Queues help maintain and retrieve recent search history for convenience.
Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Frontend Development: PyQt framework using widgets like QTableWidget, QListWidget, and QWebEngineView for an interactive user interface.
APIs: Google Maps API for location-based services and real-time navigation.
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib and PyQtGraph for displaying statistical or graphical data.
Backend Algorithms: Advanced data structures and algorithms for search, optimization, and dynamic data management.
Data Structures and Algorithms

The system leverages key data structures and algorithms to ensure efficiency and accuracy:

Trees: Used for search auto-completion to enhance the search functionality.
Graphs: Applied for route optimization and shortest path calculations between tourist spots
Stacks: Support backtracking navigation for revisiting previous routes.
Linked Lists: Manage dynamic itineraries by enabling addition or removal of locations.
Queues: Maintain search history for quick access to previous searches.
Hash Tables: Allow fast lookups for storing and retrieving tourist spot details.
Future Enhancements

While the current system is limited to a desktop application, future enhancements include:

Mobile Application:

 Developing a mobile version for better portability and accessibility, as users cannot always carry laptops while traveling.
API Integrations: Expanding API integrations to include live weather updates, public transport schedules, and real-time traffic information.
User Control Enhancements: Allowing travelers to suggest new destinations or edit tourist spot details, making the system more interactive and user-driven.
